# unity_story_editor
Visual story/dialog editor for long-term game project. Built with the intent to make building complex dialog trees intuitive, increasing asset throughput and quality.

NOTES:

This custom editor has a lot of uniquely defined behaviors that are specifically for the game it is built for. Most who see this probably won't find a direct use in their own game without heavy modification, and would also need to adapt a dialog parser that takes the outputted information.

The project itself has no plan to be maintained beyond completion either. There are certainly some design and architectural things I'd love to change if I had infinite time, but have left as-is because my main focus is perfecting the game, not this tool. That being said, you may find how certain behaviors are implemented, such as TextArea copy/paste, which I have found no good references online for.
